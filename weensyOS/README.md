Project 4 - WeensyOS
====================


## Design Overview:

## Collaborators: 

## Extra Credit Attempted:

Created a system call that lets one process kill another process (or itself)!

Sleep System Call
Easy. Create a new system call that puts the calling process to sleep until a given amount of time (measured in ticks) elapses. Note that ticks will count timer interrupts!

## How long did it take to complete WeensyOS?

35 hours
